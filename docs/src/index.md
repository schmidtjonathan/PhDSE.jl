**PhDSE** stands for **P**robabilistic **h**igh-**D**imensional **S**tate **E**stimation. Its aim is to provide runtime- and memory-efficient implementations of inference algorithms in probabilistic state-space models - all implemented in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

### Install

The package is in a very early phase of development and will likely be subject to significant changes in both the interface, as well as the inner workings.
Therefore, it is for now not registered as a Julia package, yet.

If you feel like playing around with the package a bit then you can install it directly from GitHub like this:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/schmidtjonathan/PhDSE.jl.git")
```
