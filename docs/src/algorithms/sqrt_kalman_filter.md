# Square-root Kalman Filter

# Note regarding Sqrt-Kalman filter implementation
The present implementation assumes **right** matrix-square roots of the involved covariance matrices.
This means that a PSD covariance matrix $\mathrm{P}$ is decomposed as

$$\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{U}^\top \mathrm{U}.$$

This is in contrast to assuming a decomposition $\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{L} \mathrm{L}^\top$, as is also often the convention.
